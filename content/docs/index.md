# Introduction

**Politigraph** is a civic-initiated open API for Thai political data developed by [WeVis](https://wevis.info), a civic technology organization. This project is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/wevisdemo/politigraph/).

We model the data using the **"graph"** data structure: a set of entities (nodes) and relationships between them (edges).

![Graph data structure](https://docs.brickschema.org/_images/node-edge-graph.png)

[Neo4jGraphQL](https://neo4j.com/docs/graphql/) is our main technology stack. GraphQL endpoint and playground is available at https://politigraph.wevis.info/graphql
